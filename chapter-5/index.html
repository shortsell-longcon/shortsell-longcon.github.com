<div class="entry-content"><br/><p>Leroy and I met up periodically over the coming months; my day job slowly sucking my will to live. I longed for my days as a greyhat, but I was afraid to quit. I&#8217;d grown complacent; resigned to collecting a paycheck for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>One day I stayed late at work. It was one of those high-rise office towers in mid-town. Couple hundred different tenants. I went down a few floors, just as the cleaning crews were arriving. I watched as they entered the offices and began vacuuming the floors, emptying the trash. On the way home, I picked up a twelve-pack of Amstel Light. Leroy was coming over to watch the Knicks game.</p>
<p>We cracked open a few beers and turned on the game, but Leroy wouldn&#8217;t shut up about insider trading.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you heard of Ivan Boesky?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rings a bell. Insider trading scandal back in the eighties?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the one. I&#8217;ve been doing some research on Wikipedia. Do you know how much he made?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enlighten me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over two hundred.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thousand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, million. But as part of his plea deal, he was only fined a hundred mil. Dude walked out of prison after three and a half years, a hundred million dollars sitting in his bank account!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather have my freedom than be a millionaire in Club Fed. I don&#8217;t particularly like jelly or syrup.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just think about it, man, a hundred million dollars. I thought you guys were saying there&#8217;s a near foolproof way of making the trades, so they could never be traced back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem is, you have to find a way to get the insider info, before you could ever make a trade.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then it clicked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The crews,&#8221; I mumbled, as a wry grin crept across my face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crew teams?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not rowing teams. Cleaning crews.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leroy wasn&#8217;t following. He&#8217;d never worked in a big office tower.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think about it,&#8221; I said, &#8220;who has nearly unfettered access to every office building in Manhattan?&#8221;</p>
<p>Leroy&#8217;s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t they lock down the computers at night? Shred important documents?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, but those are just systems, right? Every system has a vulnerability.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, hardware-based keystroke loggers, for one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;English please, Sir Wozniak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So Roger the Accountant logs out of his machine and heads home for the night. That&#8217;s what IT tells him to do. When you walk away from your machine, even for five minutes&#8211;to get a cup of coffee&#8211;you&#8217;re supposed to lock it down. Of course, no one really follows that rule. But most people either have a screen-saver lock, or just logoff when they head home for the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, none of those measures even matter if you have physical access to a machine. This is a never-ending debate among IT Sec. Some folks believe that machines should be impenetrable, even when a potential attacker has physical access. Hence, locking down the machine when you walk away for a second. Of course, whole new attack vectors open up if you have physical access to a box. Especially if you can come back, every few nights, and collect sifted data.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So what, you come back each night and download their megabytes?&#8221;</p>
<p>I laughed. Leroy is clueless about technology, so I pulled out a thumb-drive to demonstrate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Picture a device, half this size. The USB end plugs into the back of the computer, but the other end has an attachment for a keyboard. The keyboard plugs into the other end. This is what they call a man-in-the-middle attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So &#8230; it records everything they type?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Only problem is, you&#8217;d need regular access to the machine, to swipe off the pilfered data.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, of course &#8230;  what&#8217;s the first thing they&#8217;re going to type? Their username and password. As soon as you&#8217;ve got that, you can probably start accessing their email and file servers remotely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shit, man. Who can get these loggers? You gotta be C-I-A or what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, of course not. Five bucks on eBay and you&#8217;re off to the races. This is kid stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>I went on and on about other techniques that were possible. Methods of extracting information from people&#8217;s computers. Backdoors, trojans, rootkits, you name it.</p>

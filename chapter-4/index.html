<div class="entry-content"><br/><p>Anyway, I&#8217;m rambling. You probably want to know about the two hundred and fifty million, so I&#8217;ll get to that in a moment.</p>

<br/><p>I finished Harvard with a dual-degree in Computer Science and PolySci (I once had dreams of law school; they were eventually relegated to the back burner). Charley was headed off to Wall St. to work for an investment bank. I won&#8217;t tell you the name; only that it does rhymes with Foldmen Slacks.</p>
<p>Leroy putted around Boston for a while, but grew restless and began roaming the east coast, leaving a trail of check fraud and identity theft in his wake.</p>
<p>The three of us stayed in touch, though. We traded stories over Facebook, Skype and GMail.</p>
<p>Charley was put off by the whole Mordecai fiasco. He felt betrayed, which is understandable. I mean we lived with the guy for nearly two years. The Harvard administration was pretty spooked about the story leaking to the press, so they did everything in their power to keep the incident hush-hush. In exchange for Leroy&#8217;s silence, Harvard agreed not to file any charges. I don&#8217;t know what they could&#8217;ve hit him with&#8211;falsifying a transcript?</p>
<p>Anyway I got a job after graduation at a software development firm in NYC. The gig was great, for a while. But then I got stuck on a death march. Eighty-hour weeks. An impossible timeline. Endless bugs and glitches. I almost quit on the spot.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, they transferred me to another division; the work came easy there. I completed my daily grind in about two hours, which left the rest of my day open to karma-filled distractions. The people on my favorite site have this obsession with bacon and narwhals. To boost my online street cred, I even crafted new memes. Ever heard of Scumbag Steve? Yeah, that was me.</p>


<br/><p>So I&#8217;m having a beer with Mordecai after work one day. I had convinced Charley to come down, despite his aversion to &#8220;that fake,&#8221; as he called him.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve got CNBC on at the bar, and there&#8217;s this story about how orange juice futures are about to get rocked by a hurricane that&#8217;s brewing down off the coast of Florida.</p>
<p>Mordecai says, &#8220;Hey Charley, remember when you explained to us how options work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, what of it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mordecai looks up at the screen. Maria&#8217;s now spouting off about some big telco merger. One stock or another is up 15%.</p>
<p>&#8220;See, look at that. Stock jumped fifteen percent in a day. But think about it&#8211;how many people knew about the merger ahead of time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably a fair number, what between both firms, their legal counsel and investment banks. Hard to keep a telco merger secret,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; Leroy went on, &#8220;the price still went up fifteen percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charley interjected, &#8220;That&#8217;s why we have insider trading laws. You&#8217;re not allowed to trade on insider information.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I get that,&#8221; said Mordecai, &#8220;but why don&#8217;t more people do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because they send you to federal pound-me-in-the-ass prison if you get caught, that&#8217;s why,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>Charley interjected, &#8220;Actually, the federal prisons where SEC violators are sent have amenities like tennis courts and shuffleboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine. No ass rape, but prison&#8217;s prison,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>Mordecai had a twinkle in his eye. I&#8217;d seen that look before.</p>
<p>&#8220;What if no one could trace the trades back to any known source at a company? Like if the trades were made in some offshore account somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it happens,&#8221; said Charley. &#8220;The problem is, people get greedy. They aren&#8217;t satisfied with one or two million, so they keep trading. Often the same stocks over and over again. The SEC monitors this kind of stuff closely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What if it was like Superman 2 &#8230; like if you made just a tiny fraction on each trade, so they wouldn&#8217;t notice?&#8221; said Leroy.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the stock market we&#8217;re talking about, not banking,&#8221; I interjected. &#8220;But yeah, I guess it&#8217;s possible. You would have to make thousands of insider trades, spread across hundreds of accounts, pocketing just a little on each trade. The SEC would probably have a tough time with that, dontcha think Charley? &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d catch you, eventually. Somehow. Some way.&#8221;</p>
<p>A beat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s been real, guys,&#8221; said Charley. &#8220;But twos a crowd and three&#8217;s a conspiracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could tell he was a little uneasy with our topic of conversation, especially given Mordecai&#8217;s checkered past.</p>

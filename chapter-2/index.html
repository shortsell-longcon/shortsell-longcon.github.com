<div class="entry-content"><br/><p>Mordecai was some piece of work. I already mentioned his film predilection. He really got into his favorites, and could do some of the best impressions I&#8217;ve ever seen. He&#8217;s gotta be up there with the guys from SNL and Second City. Mordecai could do everyone from Christopher Walken to Eddie Murphy, from Cartman to Stewie. Even Jeff Goldblum. Mordecai was a pro. He had the mannerisms down, too. He&#8217;d even sit here and watch the BBC&#8211;a broadcast of the British House of Commons&#8211;for hours on end. Just practicing his high English.</p>
<p>So Charley and I were discussing financial instruments one day. I had heard of options, vaguely.</p>
<p>Charley broke it down for me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say you&#8217;re an orange juice producer. Tropicana, for example. The season is going well. Plenty of sunshine early in the year down there in Florida. But what if a blizzard rolls through in February? Not a <em>blizzard</em> blizzard, but a Florida blizzard. A cool patch that lasts a few weeks, stunting the orange crop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fewer oranges available means the price of oranges go up. If you&#8217;re an OJ producer, like Tropicana, you&#8217;re screwed. You might end up having to pay double, in the extreme, for the same quantity of oranges.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where options come in,&#8221; Charley said. &#8220;While your season is going as expected, let&#8217;s say you purchase ten thousand OJ futures with a three month expiration. Wait, you probably have no idea what that means. Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll explain. An option doesn&#8217;t cost very much. Let&#8217;s say&#8211;three dollars for the purpose of this example. So ten thousand options would cost thirty-thousand dollars. Not a whole helluva lot for Tropicana. But remember&#8211;you&#8217;re out that thirty thousand no matter what. Options aren&#8217;t like stocks. You don&#8217;t have to sell them later on. Rather, acquiring an option gives you an option to buy that commodity at a later date, for the specified price.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s like a hedge?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kind of,&#8221; Charley continued, &#8220;back to our example. You&#8217;ve got your ten thousand OJ futures options that you paid thirty grand for. All of a sudden, there&#8217;s a cold front in Brazil, where much of the world&#8217;s orange crop is grown. Without options, you&#8217;d be stuck paying retail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead you get to pay the option price?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Keep in mind, we&#8217;re talking about CALL options here. Not PUTs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a PUT?&#8221; asked Mordecai.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s just stick with CALL options, for now,&#8221; said Charley. &#8220;So you purchased ten thousand CALL options to buy OJ futures at say, $90, anytime in the next three months. Let&#8217;s say the cold front never happened. There&#8217;s a good chance OJ could be trading at, oh, anywhere from $85 to $110 within those months. If it were at $85, the options would be worthless. After all, acquiring the options gave you a right to purchase OJ contracts at $90. Why would you pay $90 when you could get them on the open market at $85?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was slowly coming to Mordecai. &#8220;Right &#8230; it&#8217;s like when a neighbor offers to sell you a hog for three fifty, but you could get one for three hundred by going to the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charley and I shared a brief look. <em>Hogs?</em></p>
<p>&#8220;But in the &#8216;Black Swan&#8217; scenario &#8230; well, it&#8217;s not quite a Black Swan,&#8221; Charley said, &#8220;but perhaps a mini-Black Swan&#8211;some butterfly in Malaysia flaps its wings, and now all the oranges in Brazil look like baby tangerines. OJ futures skyrocket to $140, say. If you&#8217;re Tropicana, you can&#8217;t just call up your supermarkets and explain to them that you don&#8217;t have any juice this season. You&#8217;re going to have to get your quarterly supply from somewhere. Perhaps raise your prices&#8211;but you couldn&#8217;t double them. People would stop buying your juice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have the options, right&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bingo. You&#8217;re sitting on 10,000 options to buy OJ at $90. Here let&#8217;s do the math …&#8221;</p>
<p>Charley got out a piece of paper and scribbled down some figures. &#8220;First, let&#8217;s assume you weren&#8217;t smart enough to buy an options, and had to purchase the OJ futures on the open market.&#8221;</p>

<br/><p>10,000 x $140 = $1,400,000</p>
<br/><p>or $1.4 million</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we calculate what you&#8217;d have to pay, if you <em>had</em> bought the options, and were exercising at the ninety dollar strike price.&#8221;</p>

<br/><p>10,000 x $90 = $900,000</p>

<p>&#8220;To see how much you saved, just subtract the two.&#8221;</p>

<br/><p>$1,400,000 - $900,000 = $500,000</p>

<p>&#8220;So your option strategy saved you half a million, this quarter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lotta Vitamin C,&#8221; said Mordecai.</p>
<p>&#8220;But wait, we also have to factor in the original option purchase price,&#8221; said Charley, still scribbling.</p>

<br/><p>$500,000 - (10,000 x $3) = $470,000</p>

<p>&#8220;So, as you can see, options saved your company four-hundred-and-seventy thousand dollars here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cha-ching.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Companies use options to mitigate risk,&#8221; Charley said. &#8220;Some quarters, that thirty thousand would be completely wasted. At other times, such as in our example, it was money well spent.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when Mordecai chimed in. He was always the prankster. He emulated Eddie Murphy&#8217;s character when he said, &#8220;What if you could, oh say, convince the world that a cold front was coming, but it was all bullshit? Like they did in that movie … what was the name of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trading Places,&#8221; I offered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Charley, &#8220;that might work on a very small scale. Prices fluctuate daily, based on this kind of news. You&#8217;d have to really convince the financial rating services who monitor these kinds of things. If they put out a negative report, the price will move.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mordecai shot us a devilish grin before returning his attention back to his latest film obsession&#8211;The Big Lebowski.</p>
<p>It was getting late and I hadn&#8217;t eaten anything for about two days, so I ordered a pizza. I always get the same thing. Creature of habit like that. Half triple-pepperoni, half pineapple, bacon and jalapeño. With extra cheese.</p>

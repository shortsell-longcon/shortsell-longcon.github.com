<div class="entry-content"><br/><p>As much as I trusted Mr. &#8220;Leroy Brown,&#8221; if that were in fact his real name, I had now put my life, my wealth (however newly-acquired), and freedom in his hands. We were both looking at some serious group shower time if our actions ever came to light.</p>
<p>At the bar that night, I decided right then, right there, that it was no longer about the money. I was in it for the thrill. Sure&#8211;a big, fat payday, too, but only if the risk was justified. Leroy and I had long ago shook hands on a 50/50 split. We&#8217;d offered a 20% cut to Charley, but he refused, flat out. Instead we paid him like any other financial services provider.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t tell him what we were up to, not exactly. In exchange, we were planning a big royal Fuck You to the boys over at Moldmen Plaques.</p>


<br/><p>Would you trust a crook with $27 million dollars? How bout two dollars? Yeah, I didn&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Yeah, Leroy was definitely in it for the money. And the thrill of it. More than anything, I think he just liked playing all those characters. He loved pushing it to the limit. Mordecai loved playing these British characters, so we had to get him a fake UK passport.</p>
<p>I asked Charley to probe his connections for a good, trustworthy lawyer who handles offshore banking. Someone in the Caymans. Switzerland, despite its reputation, is not the haven for privacy-seeking billionaires it used to be.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when I met Sal. I won&#8217;t use his last name, for obvious reasons. But before I met the man, I had to take a few &#8220;necessary precautions.&#8221; I spent two weeks running a full background check on the guy. I checked everything. Forget public databases. Sure, I ran him through all those and he came up clean. Near-perfect credit score. Pays his bills on time. Married for twenty-seven years.</p>
<p>But I also hired a P.I. down in Grand Cayman. The dick tracked Sal&#8211;his every move&#8211;for a week. Guy&#8217;s clean as a whistle. We interviewed former business associates and clients. We even found an old college acquaintance of his from Rutgers, who spoke to us off the record. Sal had never touched a drop of liquor in his life. Never smoked a joint. Probably never even took a drag off a cigarette.</p>
<p>I flew down to meet Sal at his office in Grand Cayman. He didn&#8217;t know this, but in my briefcase was a freshly-withdrawn, birthday cake-size stack of benjies. One million dollars to be exact. We estimated Sal&#8217;s net worth to be a little over $250k. And I was about to change his life with a small taste of Fuck You Money &#8230; as they call it in HedgeFund Land.</p>


<br/><p>Sal runs a one-man, boutique operation out of downtown Grand Cayman. His secretary is a large black woman by the name of Condoleeza. They&#8217;ve been a team for over fifteen years.</p>
<p>I met Sal on a muggy afternoon; just another day in the Caribbean. Sal&#8217;s shiny bald head glistened in the sweltering heat. The window AC unit gulped for life. Sal wore a suit, black Italian, but it had seen better days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. [redacted], what I&#8217;m looking for, specifically, is someone to handle my affairs, in the event of my &#8230; how shall we say, early expiration.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I would like to setup is a dead man&#8217;s switch. I will give you a codebook with monthly encryption keys. Each month you will receive a communiqu√© from me. It may contain instructions, or just a simple message, such as, &#8216;I am alive.&#8217; You will decrypt my message and follow any instructions provided.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This might be a little beyond me, technology-wise &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about that. If you choose to represent me, I will show you how to use the codebook and encryption keys. Don&#8217;t worry&#8211;they were using these techniques on submarines in 1946. It&#8217;s a simple yet secure method of communication.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright, continue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If three months elapse, without you hearing from me, you are to trigger the dead man&#8217;s switch. I shall give you the instructions ahead of time, in the event this occurs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which are?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have said everything I&#8217;m willing to say at this point. If you agree to be my counsel, we will then be covered by attorney-client privilege and I can say more. Let me assure you&#8211;I will never ask you to do anything illegal. Not in this country, nor in the United States. I do ask that you never inquire about the origin of my funds. Is that clear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, as much as it can be. Mr. &#8230; what did you say your name was again?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was trying to catch me off guard. I had scheduled the appointment under a fake name, to protect my interests in case he balked.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not important, Sal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I will have to think about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should let you know, this offer implodes as soon as I walk out that door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh &#8230; I see,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I figured you might think I&#8217;m full of shit, so I brought a down payment. That is, if you choose to represent me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I put the briefcase on his desk, opened it, and turned it to face him.</p>
<p>His eyes looked like giant balloons.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one million dollars in unmarked benjamins. Go ahead, touch them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sal picked up a stack of the bills. He pulled one of the bills out and held it up to the light. He&#8217;d seen his share of benjies&#8211;real <em>and</em> fake.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a deal,&#8221; said Sal, sticking out his hand.</p>
<p>I reached across and shook it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, please empty the briefcase,&#8221; I said politely.</p>
<p>Sal pulled stack after stack of hundred-dollar bills out of the case. As the bottom drew closer, a portion of a black and white photograph could be seen.</p>
<p>He finished emptying the case. At the bottom: a black and white photograph of an attractive, middle-aged woman. She was shopping at a local strip mall.</p>
<p>It was time to stay strong. Play it cool. Show an epic poker face&#8211;like I was playing at the final table of the WSOP. I had to convince Sal that I was willing to carry out my &#8230; insurance policy. At the bottom of the briefcase were seven black and white photographs, snapped by my private investigator. It was Sal&#8217;s wife, at the mall. One of his kids, at the playground. Another one of his kids, playing in their yard.</p>
<p>Sal got the message.</p>
<p>&#8220;You protect my interests, I protect yours,&#8221; I said.</p>

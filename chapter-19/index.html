<div class="entry-content"><br/><p>Tuesday morning, Mordecai&#8217;s Lincoln pulled up to the bank. A senior bank VP had come out to supervise the operation. He shook Leroy&#8217;s hand and escorted him into the bank. There they signed some legal documents making the transfer official. Leroy and his female entourage got back in the Lincoln. They followed the armored car, a few lengths behind.</p>
<p>Over the course of a week, Mordecai had transformed his warehouse into a veritable fortress, replete with rent-a-cops. The armored car pulled up around back. The guards unloaded three pallets worth of cash. Twenties and tens, mostly.</p>
<p>Then we waited. Every rent-a-cop we&#8217;d spotted had left the building by five p.m., but Leroy didn&#8217;t leave the entire night. I pictured him in there, like Scrooge McDuck, swan-diving into massive piles of cash.</p>
<p>Jimmy kept a vigil while I headed back to the motel. We&#8217;d have to work in shifts to monitor Leroy and the cash, 24/7.</p>

<br/><p>But the cash never moved. And neither did Mordecai. Every night, around ten, he&#8217;d get Chinese food delivered. But that&#8217;s all I ever saw of him.</p>
<p>Sure, I knew &#8230; on some level, I could go in there, guns blazing, and take the $25 million. There was always the digital approach. But I didn&#8217;t have access to Leroy&#8217;s laptop or banking codes. So e-theft was out.</p>
<p>If I robbed Leroy and grabbed the $25 million, what would happen to the rest? That&#8217;s what held me back the most. I could tie up Mordecai and leave him for the Feds, but then he&#8217;d turn states evidence against me. I could leave and grant Mordecai his freedom, but then he&#8217;d just walk away with $275 million. Half of which was mine. Well, technically, it belonged to hundreds of thousands of different investors, each of whom lost a few pennies to a few dollars, but still. It was <em>now</em> mine.</p>
<p>So we waited.</p>

<br/><p>Over the following two weeks, three more shipments of cash arrived, bringing the total to $100 million.</p>
<p>Early Friday morning, we were greeted with a surprise. Through all of our surveillance and monitoring, somehow we missed it. An even-larger armored truck pulled up to the back of Leroy&#8217;s little warehouse turned bank vault. The side of the truck read &#8220;Rothstein Precious Metals.&#8221; The cargo was sealed in black tarps. The guards unloaded crate after crate of whatever it was Mordecai had purchased.</p>
<p>I decided it was time to make a move. That night I&#8217;d go in for the dough. A real smash and grab job, if that&#8217;s what it took. Jimmy supplied me with a glock, but I didn&#8217;t bother loading it. I&#8217;d rather go to prison, or end up dead, than actually have to shoot someone.</p>

<br/><p>Sometime after ten, Mordecai finally left the warehouse. At last: a golden opportunity. I picked the lock and entered the back entrance.</p>
<p>It looked official alright. But a little poking around revealed the entire vault to be a sham. I went around to the side of the building, where for the first time I noticed a side door. It was a gaping hole in our surveillance. One could easily cut through the buildings next door, down a small path, and out to the street.</p>
<p>I went back inside and noticed an area near the ceiling&#8211;about four inches&#8211;where the vault did not extend. I came back with a ladder. My hands were shaking as I made my way to the top.</p>
<p>I poked my head over the steel divider and peered down.</p>
<p><em>Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck motherfucker cocksucker motherfucker.</em> It was gone. All of it. The precious metals (whatever it was), the cash&#8211;all of it. I got the hell outta there and called Jimmy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you have him?&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m just waiting at the hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Call me as soon as you see him. I&#8217;m going back to the motel and seeing if the GPS trackers I ordered have come in. From now on, we need eyes and ears on target, twenty-four seven.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got it, boss. Oh and, I know it&#8217;s a bad time &#8230; but about my payment?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bring thirty g&#8217;s cash to the hotel. Will that be enough for now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing, boss.&#8221;</p>

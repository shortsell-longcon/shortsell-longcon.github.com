<div class="entry-content"><br/><p>So everything was going great until junior year. I had a few web apps running that were netting me a few g&#8217;s per month. Nothing huge. Not Zuck Bucks, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p>A Silicon Valley startup got in touch with me through one of my netherworld contacts. The startup was building a new peer-to-peer hotel model, where people would put up rooms for rent online. You may have heard of them. Apparently they&#8217;re kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>They needed to get traffic rolling, and were having success by reaching out to renters on Craigslist. I built them this automated system that would contact renters on CL and pitch them on their new site. None of it could be traced back to the startup. The trick was to send the emails from an innocuous looking GMail account. &#8220;Brenda James&#8221; or &#8220;Amanda Pritchfield&#8221; would send an email to people who were renting rooms on Craiglist. Just a quick, simple, &#8220;Hey, have you heard of [redacted]? I&#8217;ve been making some extra money by listing my room for rent on there.&#8221;</p>

<br/><p>Meanwhile, I was struggling academically at Hahhvahd. Certainly my grades weren&#8217;t good enough to get into a top JD or MBA program. My goal was always to turn legit one day and start a successful company. The problem? I get bored too easily. Projects always seem to lose their luster after six months or so.</p>
<p>You know how I was telling you that Mordecai never seemed to study? That&#8217;s odd at Harvard, as you might imagine. Crimsonites are quintessentially hyper-competitive. That guy studying next to you in the library? He&#8217;s your competition down at the ibank. That head writer for the Harvard Lampoon? She&#8217;s gunning for the writing gig on Conan, or The Simpsons.</p>
<p>Mordecai was taking nearly a double load. He had to get special permission from an assistant dean, just to take that many classes. And he&#8217;d aced nearly all of them.</p>
<p>Then came the Differential Equations II final. It was closed book, which was unusual. The professor did not allow any notes or cheat sheets of any kind.</p>
<p>Mordecai kept blowing his nose during the test. He&#8217;d leave his handkerchief out on the desk, blowing his nose a few minutes later. The professor was kind of a germ freak so he offered Mordecai a box of tissues. Mordecai accepted, but the professor grew suspicious when he failed to put the handkerchief away. The prof circled the room, keeping an eye on Mordecai. He passed by his desk a few times, until he noticed something odd.</p>
<p>Mordecai seemed to be looking back and forth between the handkerchief and the exam. The professor walked towards Mordecai. As he approached, Mordecai took the handkerchief off the table finally and placed it into his pocket. There were ten minutes left to finish the exam. The professor stepped out of class for a moment and called the assistant dean.</p>
<p>The dean arrived shortly before the exam was over. When Mordecai went to drop off his test, they asked him to stick around until all the students were finished.</p>
<p>After all had filed out, the dean said, &#8220;What&#8217;s this all about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Johnson, will you kindly produce your handkerchief for our perusal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why? What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>By now the dean was really curious. Why wouldn&#8217;t Mordecai just cough up the handkerchief? What was he hiding?</p>
<p>&#8220;Produce the handkerchief or I&#8217;m placing you on academic suspension until further notice,&#8221; said the dean.</p>
<p>Mordecai produced the handkerchief. The professor and dean studied it closely. Of course, it didn&#8217;t take much to realize that the elaborate designs were in fact equations and sample problems, from previous exams. The dean remarked later, that it was perhaps the most sophisticated act of cheating he&#8217;d ever witnessed.</p>
<p>Mordecai had found a factory in China that would produce one-off items for him. Samples, Mordecai explained to the factory owner, for a potential 10,000-lot order. Mordecai had been cheating like this for years, with none the wiser. Usually blue handkerchiefs with white designs, but he&#8217;d switch it up every now and again.</p>

<br/><p>Such obvious cheating at Harvard raised all kinds of red flags. What else about this kid was phony or fabricated? The administration started digging deeper into Mordecai&#8217;s past.</p>
<p>Turns out, Mordecai was no Johnson Randolph the third. His name was Leroy Brown, though he was indeed from Fayetteville, Arkansas. He dropped out of high school in the ninth grade. Could barely read and write, at the time. He was entirely self-taught from that point on. Of course, no one from his high school had ever applied to Harvard. So Leroy forged a few documents and sent along his transcript, giving Harvard the address of an old farmhouse down the road. Leroy took over the telephone at his grandma&#8217;s house for a month, answering with, &#8220;Jasper West High, how may I help you?&#8221; in the voice of a woman. He used several other voices to give himself glowing recommendations&#8211;one from the principal and another from his English teacher.</p>
<p>For the SATs, Mordecai, or Leroy, as it were, hired a ringer out in Los Angeles. The ringer&#8217;s ID had the kid&#8217;s actual photo, but the name &#8220;Mordecai Johnson Randolph.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mordecai figured out that there&#8217;s a half-hour window between the time students on the east coast finish the SATs and the time students on the west coast start them. If you could just get the right answers during that window, it would be trivial for a student on the west coast to sneak them in on an index card. And voil√†&#8211;you have yourself a perfect SAT score.</p>
<p>Of course&#8211;the College Board is onto this trick, so they put out different versions of the test. But they can only produce so many versions. Mordecai paid off five honor-roll students, all located on the Eastern seabord. Three of them happened to get the same test. Between the three, they got most of the answers correct on the verbal and math sections. They jotted down the details of the questions they weren&#8217;t 100% on, and came up with the answers later.</p>
<p>Starting in 2005, the College Board added a writing section to the SATs. Leroy&#8217;s ringer out in Los Angeles was an out-of-work screenwriter. A twenty year-old writing prodigy who could crank out essays like a madman.</p>
<p>There was probably just a 25% chance that the ringer would in fact get the same version of the test as the three on the east coast.</p>
<p>Mordecai rolled the dice and they came up deuce. The ringer&#8217;s essay ended up scoring an 11 out of a possible 12. Not bad.</p>

<br/><p>Scoring a perfect 1600 on the SAT helps, but does not guarantee one admission to Harvard. The fake transcript and phony recommendations put Leroy over the top.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s incredible, really. Harvard should give Leroy an honorary degree, just for the sheer amount of ingenuity that went into his plan.</p>
<p>After his flameout at Harvard, Mordecai laid all this out for me over a couple of pints down in Cambridge. And&#8211;for the first time in my life, I heard Leroy&#8217;s native accent.</p>
<p>When we first met, continuing on for over two years, Leroy spoke with this northeastern accent. He told me he learned the phrasing and cadence from watching movies like Dead Poets Society and The Emperor&#8217;s Club. That and from listening to old speeches made by JFK and the whole Kennedy clan. &#8220;To give that dignified sound,&#8221; said Mordecai.</p>

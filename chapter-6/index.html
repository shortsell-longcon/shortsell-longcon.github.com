<div class="entry-content"><br/><p>Let me be straight here, before I continue: I never started out thinking, <em>hey, you know what I should do with my life? Become a criminal</em>. It was just a game for me. An elaborate exercise in penetration testing. Sure, one that would go on to reward me handsomely. And the victim? Well, it was kind of like when you download a song illegally off the internet. Sure, there&#8217;s a victim. But he/she/it is so far removed, you&#8217;re hardly aware there is one. Is Britney Spears really going to be harmed because I download <em>Baby One More Time</em>, when I never in a million years would have actually, you know, <em>paid</em> for it? Well, our victims were kind of like that. Institutional investors, worth billions, who lost a few cents or few dollars on each trade.</p>
<p>Charley, meanwhile, became disillusioned at Gutbloom Macks. Seeing how the sausage is made and all. Rampant greed and corruption. Putting the company&#8217;s bottom line ahead of the clients&#8217;. What&#8217;s it they say&#8230; <em>give a man a gun, and he can rob a bank. Give a man a bank, and he can rob the world?</em></p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t easy, but Leroy and I eventually convinced Charley to join our ranks. We needed his expertise. Especially in the area of international banking. But for the most part, we kept Charley out of the loop. He didn&#8217;t want any of the money, and didn&#8217;t ask questions. It was better that way.</p>
<p>Between the three of us, we barely had enough funds to get our first few accounts going. We managed to scrape together $13k. Leroy obtained a variety of fake IDs and identities, which Charley used when setting up the offshore trading accounts. He opened up three for starters&#8211;in the Cayman Islands, Liechtenstein and Antigua.</p>


<br/><p>Next, we created our own cleaning services firm, incorporated in New York State. Tippy-Top Clean Team, we called it. We drummed up a few small clients, but keep in mind&#8211;we were targeting the big boys. Anyone trading on the NYSE, NASDAQ, etc.</p>
<p>Leroy rustled up a few janitors for our crew, while I played the role of their manager. The process was extremely time-consuming. At the moment, I was still trying to hold down my day job until we knew for sure that our little scheme had legs.</p>
<p>Pretty soon we realized that most major Fortune 500 companies already had existing contracts with cleaning services. Our firm was too small to compete. We had to get our foot in the door with a bigger firm. One who already had existing contracts.</p>
<p>Leroy staked out several of the large office towers here in NYC. Specifically, offices housing finance divisions. If we could get access to the office of a junior CFO, perhaps a midlevel accountant, then we might have a chance of getting an early peek at a company’s earnings statement. That could be a goldmine.</p>


<br/><p>Leroy found a cleaning firm that fit the bill. He staked out a crew as they were sent from building to building one night. The next morning, he made contact with one of the janitors. They came to, how shall we say, an <em>agreement</em>.</p>
<p>The next night, Leroy planted coke on the cleaning crew manager. He paid the inside man to rat the guy out. Personally, I&#8217;m not proud of our actions here. But Leroy was running this end of the show and I didn&#8217;t have much say in the matter.</p>
<p>In the morning, I went down to their office with a fake ID and falsified resume. I came <em>highly recommended</em> from the janitor&#8211;our inside man. It’s amazing what $200 and a case of Bud Light can get you.</p>
<p>I was hired on the spot and went out on my first assignment that night. It was our first op; we agreed to target some low-hanging fruit. It was an industrial services company, based out of the Midwest. But all of their finance and accounting is done right here in NYC. Very unsophisticated IT department, from what we could gather.</p>


<br/><p>&#8220;Ron, you and Esmerelda take the front offices, I&#8217;ll get the bathrooms, and the offices in the back,&#8221; I said. It was our first assignment. I scrubbed toilets for a while before taking a look around. When I graduated from Harvard, never in a million years did I suspect that one day I&#8217;d be cleaning toilets.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s IT systems were rudimentary. Windows 2000, mostly. Some of the machines even had old CRT monitors. Ugh. I scoped out the floor, looking for an office that seemed like it belonged to someone important. The southeast corner office was huge, with a fantastic view of the city.</p>
<p>After vacuuming for a bit, I got down on my knees and attached the keystroke logger to the back of the machine. IT would never suspect a thing. Sure, maybe if the guy needed to call in IT for an upgrade, or if his hard-drive crashed. But no one would be checking the keyboard cable on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I cleaned a few more offices and installed the rest of the loggers on the highest-value targets I could find. At five a.m., I called it a night. I had to be at work by nine.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><br/><p>We hired an ex-Google engineer named Raj to deal with our torrent of data. I didn&#8217;t trust a soul with the encryption keys to our master database, so he always worked from a sample. We were up to three full racks of servers at our host in the Netherlands. The data was locked down with NSA-strength, 2048-bit encryption. The key was a string of 264 characters that I had memorized. It was a poem, in fact. Part of T.S. Elliot&#8217;s <em>The Wasteland</em>. The characters were then converted into leet-speek for added security. &#8220;Th1s 1s t3h w@y t3h w0rld 3nds. N0t w1th @ b@ng, but @ w1mp3r.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure, someone could torture me for the key, but I didn&#8217;t think the CIA would get involved in a financial crime under the jurisdiction of the SEC.</p>
<p>I setup Raj with a 2TB worth of sample data. Small potatoes in his realm. We offered him a $225k per year salary to lure him away from Google. No perks. Just the cash. I explained to him how we were a startup who&#8217;s aim was to combat insider trading. That is, our software would be installed on corporate servers. It would sift through the company&#8217;s internal email and document stores, searching for information that employees may be using to make inside trades.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got the data from a potential client. They installed a packet sniffer in one of their core routers,&#8221; I explained to Raj, lying my ass off. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking for employees who may have potential access to information that they can use to make inside trades.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raj worked his magic, and within three weeks, we had a prototype coded in C++ and Redis. It was code-named Raptor and could sift through terabytes worth of data in minutes.</p>
<p>I patched the OS kernel on all our servers in Holland, so they could take advantage of the latest updates. Deployed Raptor via git before running the app against our main dbase.</p>
<p>Within minutes, we had seventeen hits.</p>


<br/><p>Operation Charley, as we called it, was coming along swimmingly. We were able to infiltrate the office of a Senior VP at the Hong Kong division of Smolden Dracks.</p>
<p>Through a combination of Mordecai&#8217;s social engineering, and some custom-brew hacks I whipped up to defeat their network security, we were able to plant a backdoor on the main computer of their VP Finance, Pan-Asian Division. This gave us a near limitless supply of data to sift through. Documents, agreements, strategic memos, client lists. You name it, we had it. We were looking for dirt on the company, not info to make trades. So the process was a bit more time consuming as we could not use Raptor on their document cache.</p>


<br/><p>That weekend, I flew down to Miami to check in on Mordecai and see where we were at. Oh, boy.</p>
<p>There was some kind of electronic music festival going on. DJs and girls in bikinis roamed the streets like so many bronzen vampires. I got in at 2 a.m. and met Mordecai at the hotel. He had rented out the penthouse suite. Of course.</p>
<p>I opened the door with my swipe card and was greeted by a vision of a scantily clad girl, passed out on a white leather couch. Her bikini halfway off, clutching a glowstick in a stupor.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the fuck is this?&#8221; I yelled at Mordecai as he appeared around the corner.</p>
<p>I wanted to say his name, but I didn&#8217;t know which pseudonym he was going by these days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Travis,&#8221; he whispered in my hear. &#8220;Travis TranceFactor.&#8221; He had become an amateur DJ of sorts.</p>
<p>&#8220;What-what the fuck is this, Travis?&#8221; I repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chill, bro. Chillax and have a cold beverage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me to fuckin&#8217; chill, bro.&#8221;</p>
<p>I ushered him into a side room where we could talk in private.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought we agreed to keep a low profile, Leroy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dawg, it&#8217;s all good. We&#8217;re just having a good time here. I&#8217;ll kick &#8216;em all out in a few, swear.&#8221;</p>
<p>A record skipped and the music stopped for a few moments. The crowd said a collective &#8220;awwwwww&#8221; before the speakers boomed to life.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the hell kind of ship are you running down here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all good, man. I was kickin&#8217; it with a few DJs at the festival, mentioned I had the penthouse back here. They all just &#8230; uh, climbed into the limo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Limo?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, just for the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jesus, Leroy. Didn&#8217;t we talk about this? About how people eventually get busted? Let me ask you this &#8230; if someone showed up here tonight. Let&#8217;s say one of those girls out there got a bad batch of ecstasy, and the cops showed up. Don&#8217;t you think they&#8217;d start asking around, wondering who rented this fucking suite?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I get it.&#8221; A beat. &#8220;I got it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leroy&#8217;s eyes were bloodshoot. Something was off about him. He was edgy and paranoid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, go watch Scarface again if you don&#8217;t believe me,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Rule number one&#8211;don&#8217;t get high on your own supply. Rule number two&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never underestimate the other guy&#8217;s greed,&#8221; we both said in unison.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I know, I know,&#8221; said Leroy, &#8220;we watched the movie a thousand times.&#8221;</p>
<p>I followed Leroy back into the main suite. As I turned the corner, I finally noticed the coffee table. A massive piece of glass, covered with giant mirrors. I watched as a girl did a huuuge line from a mirror labeled &#8220;coke&#8221; in purple lipstick. Others were labeled: MDMA, dutch fantasy, shrooms, afghan kush, maui wowie and china beach.</p>
<p>It was too much. I strode up to the makeshift DJ booth and pulled the plug on the first cable I found. The music screeched to a halt.</p>
<p>The crowd uttered another chorus of &#8220;awwwwwwwww&#8221;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, people. Sorry to bust up the party but you have to leave, now,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>The DJs and scenesters uttered &#8220;party pooper&#8221; and &#8220;buzzkill&#8221; under their breath, but began picking up their things. I knew Leroy would be pissed, but he was headed down the wrong path with these kind of shenanigans.</p>

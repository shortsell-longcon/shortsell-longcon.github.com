<div class="entry-content"><br/><p>You might be wondering why I&#8217;m revealing my story. After all, I got away with it. A poor kid from the Bronx&#8211;but here I am, $250 million dollars richer.</p>
<p>Let me back up a bit.</p>
<p>This is Charley. He&#8217;s my roommate, or was, back at Harvard. Charley&#8217;s hunched over a textbook, knee-deep in financial equations. I have no idea what they mean. It&#8217;s like when he looks at my computer screen. The Matrix, he calls it.</p>
<p>But I learned a lot from Charley. Charley turned me on to trading. He was convinced that he could come up with a formula, or really, a formula of formulas, that could beat the market. This is the holy grail when it comes to trading. He said that certain hedge funds had figured out a system, but it only worked for a while. Then shit would go south, like when LTCM had to get bailed out for a couple hundred billion.</p>
<p>These are called Black Swan events.</p>
<p>Charley turned me on to micro-transactions. Trades that are executed via software alone. Meaning, no human was ever involved in the decision to buy or sell. Wait&#8211;that&#8217;s not exactly correct. A human was involved in the creation of the software, but once it&#8217;s let loose on the world, the program trades using a mind of its own.</p>
<p>By the time Maria Bartiwhoha is yapping about the latest news on CNBC, it&#8217;s too late for the average investor. High-frequency trading bots will have already wiped out much of the profit-taking opportunity. Johnny E-Trade, however savvy, doesn&#8217;t stand a chance. Even with the fastest, dedicated trading setup, by the time Johnny tries to react, it&#8217;s too late.</p>

<br/><p>Wait, let me back up.</p>
<p>This is me. Hunched over a DOS terminal at the age of twelve. It was my first computer. Well, it was my dad&#8217;s. But I used it so much, he didn&#8217;t have time to use WordPerfect anymore. Dad got an upgrade; I got my first PC.</p>
<p>You know how Matt Damon told that girl in <em>Good Will Hunting</em> how he could <em>just play</em>? That was me when it came to hacking.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to know:</p>
<p>Your computer is a system.</p>
<p>The network is a system.</p>
<p>The Internet, interwebs and all things in between are just systems.</p>
<p>Systems are governed by rules; but the rules are implemented by humans. And every human has flaws.</p>
<p>Your toaster, for example, is governed by a set of rules. If you know what to look for, you can exploit the rules&#8211;to find a vulnerability in the system.</p>
<p>You can take apart your toaster and figure out how it works by looking at the components. The thing is&#8211;most people are afraid to take apart their toaster.</p>
<p>I took apart and rebuilt my first PC over fifteen times until I could do it blindfolded. A motherboard here, CPU there, RAM here, PCI card there, et cetera. Do you want one piece of advice on getting better at technology? Well here it is: don&#8217;t be afraid to break things.</p>
<p>You know why your mom or grandma doesn&#8217;t know how to use the computer very well? She&#8217;s afraid she&#8217;s going to break it. And yeah, she probably has before, by installing some app that made her cursor look like a frog that danced. But that wasn&#8217;t the problem. The problem was the payload. The malware embedded in the frog-cursor app that made penis pill ads pop up whenever she clicked on the big blue E.</p>


<br/><p>So Charley and I became best mates, of sorts. I&#8217;d show him the scripts and hacks I was working out. He&#8217;d try to explain the latest ideas in finance, gleaned mostly from Harvard&#8217;s top-notch research library. Or the bits he picked up on insider blogs and finance forums.</p>
<p>Wait, let me back up. I said &#8220;hacks&#8221; earlier. Back to this word again. It&#8217;s a shame, really. A hack is merely a clever solution to a problem. The term &#8220;hack&#8221; can also mean, of course, a shoddy worker. As I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard writers referred to as hacks. There are two ideas going on here. One: a hack gets the job done. Two: they may not do so in the most elegant or maintainable fashion. That&#8217;s the beauty of a hack. In the world of savvy techs, people like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg are hackers. The Kevin Mitnicks of the world&#8211;the outlaws? Those are crackers. As in, they crack into systems&#8211;like one might a safe, or a bank vault.</p>
<p>So as you might have guessed, I got pretty good at hacking. If you&#8217;ve seen the movie <em>The Social Network</em>, there&#8217;s a scene where Zuck builds the first version of Facebook in a night. He wrote a script to scrape his classmates&#8217; photos, then re-hosted them in a database. (His dorm room, by the way, was in the same building where I stayed freshman year.) The birth of Facebook is the quintessential hack.</p>
<p>For some reason, hacking scripts together for a legitimate purpose never held much appeal to me. I was what they call <em>grey hat</em>, meaning, my work wasn&#8217;t exactly black hat, as in sending out 100 million Nigerian Prince emails, but it wasn&#8217;t 100% kosher, either.</p>


<br/><p>Back to Charley. Sophomore year, we needed to find a new place to live. Most people ended up in three or four-person suites. That&#8217;s when we met Mordecai. He was our third. Mordecai Johnson Randolph III, as he liked to be called.</p>
<p>This guy was some piece of work. I should know. I eventually became business partners with him. Mordecai was, how shall we say, <em>instrumental</em> to my financial success.</p>
<p>He was a natural showman with innate charisma. When we met him for coffee to discuss being our roommate, he showed up in a suit and tie. And no, he wasn&#8217;t just coming from a debate, although he was head of the debate team for a while. The funny thing was, I never saw Mordecai lift a book. He&#8217;d just sit there in our living room, watching TV in his sports coat and khakis. &#8220;Never know when someone important might drop by,&#8221; he&#8217;d say.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you all about Mordecai&#8217;s dirty little secret, but for now, suffice it to say that this guy rivaled Jack Kennedy when it came to looks, charm and charisma. Integrity? That&#8217;s another matter entirely.</p>

<br/><p>Pretty soon Mordecai&#8217;s ears perked up whenever Charley and I were discussing something. A new trading algorithm. A clever hack. He loved hearing about my latest exploits. And the formulas that Charley kept concocting. I was a little wary of letting Mordecai into our inner circle, but I didn&#8217;t really have a choice. He was going to be our roommate for a year, and he&#8217;d just sit there on the couch, watching those movies of his on an endless loop.</p>

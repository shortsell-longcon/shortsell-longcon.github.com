<div class="entry-content"><br/><p>Our big opportunity came when Mordecai infiltrated a well-known startup out in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Wait, let me back up.</p>
<p>You see, the janitorial services angle only got us so far. A lot of companies had existing contracts, and we couldn&#8217;t get gigs with all of them. So my old pal Mordecai got creative. He&#8217;d read an old article from back in the late 90&#8217;s&#8211;the dot-com bubble days. The writer claimed to have just showed one day at a startup in SoMa. He claimed an empty desk and just started working. Crazy, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, we knew it wouldn&#8217;t fly at most companies. But we scoped out several&#8211;some of our hot targets&#8211;and analyzed their hiring practices. We found out the trick was to come in as an outside contractor or consultant. Oftentimes, one leg of a company will hire a consulting firm, whose consultants then have nearly free reign at the entire company.</p>
<p>DealsOn X was the high-flying, pre-IPO startup of the moment. Mordecai just showed up one day, dressed to the nines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you must be new here?&#8221; a woman asked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m a consultant with Archer Mendelson. Doing a little profit analysis for the new CRM rollout.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that was that. DealsOn was too concerned with making themselves look more profitable than they really were, to notice a guy like Mordecai roaming the halls.</p>

<br/><p>From operations, Mordecai was able to infiltrate the finance arm. Much of it was outsourced anyway, so Mordecai just pretended to be an outside partner.</p>
<p>The moneyshot was buried within dealings the company had with its numerous partners. DealsOn X was using some dirty accounting tricks to book revenues that, technically, weren&#8217;t actually revenues. They were more like IOUs. But the partner contracts had opt-out clauses, which were being executed left and right. Meanwhile DealsOn was still posting the non-existent revenue to its bottom line. DealsOn X&#8230; more like, CrapOn X.</p>
<p>Mordecai gathered the proof that we needed to blow this IPO out of the water.</p>
<p>Then we waited.</p>

<br/><p>The IPO price of DealsOn X was slated for $26 a share. But the ibank handling the deal wanted a guaranteed pop for their pre-IPO investors, so they priced it at a more modest $23.</p>
<p>I woke up at 5am that morning to check on the pre-IPO morning buzz. There at my battle station, I used four of the screens to monitor the current share price and trading volume. The rest of the screens were wired up through Milkmaid, awaiting trade orders. We couldn&#8217;t use options on this one because of the timing issues. We had to be able to get in and out, fast.</p>
<p>Also, I didn&#8217;t tell Leroy this, but I was hoping that this would be my final op of the mission. He wanted to keep going. Damn fool. He really believed he could be a billionaire and, you know, somehow not get caught.</p>

<br/><p>The night before, I&#8217;d compiled the cache of DealsOn X dirt that Mordecai had ransacked. And boy, was it a doozy. The plan was to get in early and ride the stock to its peak, then short it before going public with the dirt. Bloggers, journalists, finance forums&#8211;we hit every angle to make sure that this turkey wouldn&#8217;t fly.</p>
<p>Insider trading is a funny thing, you know? Congress, as of this writing, is allowed to make insider trades. Your elected Senator, perhaps, sits on a defense committee. He can receive classified information in a briefing, then go home, call his broker &#8230; and profit from this classified information.</p>
<p>But you and I, as private citizens? If we do this, and get caught, we get arrested. Yeah, sounds fair to me.</p>

<br/><p>Due to a surge of buys in pre-market trading, the share price of DealsOn X opened at $27. Not bad. We had already grossed a cool $2.5 million.</p>
<p>But this stock was on fire.</p>
<p>Within an hour of its open, it was trading at $46. <em>Holy shit, this could be it</em>.</p>
<p>I felt like I was back in 1999, re-living the dot-com boom.</p>
<p>By 3pm EST the stock was trading at $58 per share. My poker gut told me that we&#8217;d hit our peak. Day-traders and profit-takers were about to make a run.</p>


<br/><p>I pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>We sold it all.</p>
<p>I waited for the trades to clear before checking the balance in our accounts. We&#8217;d been using margin, so we were able to leverage our now $430 million into almost $750 million in capital.</p>
<p>I checked the screens and ran a Milkmaid script to tally up the new account totals. I almost threw up a little bit in my mouth. The total read:</p>
<p>$480. Million. Dollars.</p>


<br/><p>We were almost there.</p>
<p>I began entering short sell trades across all our accounts. It was time for DealsOn X to take a fall. A swan dive from the nosebleeds.</p>
<p>Once all the shorts were in play, I began firing off the incriminating evidence against DealsOn to an email database of bloggers and journalists.</p>
<p>The email read:</p>

<br/><p>Dear [redacted],</p>

<br/><p>I have been following your work for years. Startup Finance Times is one of my favorite resources for getting up to date news and information.</p>

<br/><p>Through a source close to DealsOn X, I have come into possession of some alarming documents.</p>

<br/><p>They seem to prove that DealsOn X has been overstating their revenues; they are actually losing thousands of partners monthly and are drowning in a sea of red.</p>

<br/><p>I&#8217;ve posted the incriminating documents at the following website for your perusal:</p>
<br/><p>http://[redacted]</p>

<br/><p>Best,</p>
<br/><p>Woodstein Bernward</p>


<br/><p>The stock closed at $54 dollars a share. Not bad. Probably the biggest one-day IPO swing of the year.</p>
<p>Our little publicity wouldn&#8217;t make headlines until the following morning. Though, we could tell from after-hours trading that insiders were already shitting their pants.</p>
<p>My posts on several of the biggest finance forums had received over 700 replies and 20,000 views.</p>

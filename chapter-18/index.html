<div class="entry-content"><br/><p>Armed with Mordecai&#8217;s list of aliases, Jimmy went to work on locating our man. The third hotel he tried was the downtown Hyatt Regency.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said Jimmy, &#8220;can you patch me through to Kensington Danforth? It&#8217;s urgent. He&#8217;s staying in room 712.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, just a second.&#8221; A beat. &#8220;Sir, our records indicate he&#8217;s staying in room 420. Perhaps he&#8217;s changed rooms since you&#8217;ve last spoken with him. Here, I&#8217;ll patch you through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Got him.</p>
<p>Jimmy setup a surveillance operation at the Hyatt; meanwhile I posted up outside Arkansas National Bank.</p>
<p>After a day of that, I grew restless. After a trip to the local spy shop, I was in business. Posing as an electrician, I installed two spy cams across the street from the bank. One above a coffee shop, the other beneath a neon &#8220;Diner&#8221; sign. With a lens the size of a button, the cameras were nearly invisible to the naked eye. They beamed a live feed to a nearby 3G modem. From there the data was sent directly to my server farm in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>I sat back, turned on HBO (quite a perk for the cheap motel), watched, and waited.</p>

<br/><p>That night, Leroy showed up at the hotel, wasted. &#8220;Yeah, he&#8217;s with some broad,&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;Quite the looker. She&#8217;s got those uh &#8230; I mean no disrespect, but whaddya call those&#8211;hooker boots? The black leather thigh-highs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, that sounds like Leroy alright. There&#8217;s one thing you should know,&#8221; I said to Jimmy, &#8220;Leroy&#8217;s quite the fan of the ladies, and he doesn&#8217;t seem to mind paying for it, if ya know what I mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Loud and clear.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day, I get a text from Jimmy: &#8220;Bishop has left the palace.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few hours later I&#8217;m watching the live feed when Jimmy pulls up in a Lincoln Town Car. He&#8217;s dressed to the nines in a pinstripe suit. Two women get out of the car with him. &#8220;Bishop is in the pocket,&#8221; I text Jimmy.</p>
<p>He&#8217;d lost the tail at the airport parking lot, so it was a good thing we had the live feed.</p>
<p>From what emerged of the case later, we know that Leroy had opened the bank account under the name &#8220;ATM Distributors Global, Inc.&#8221; There was a major ATM distributor by the same name, only, without the Global. These are the people who made a fortune by stocking every mini-part, strip joint and fast-food shop with an ATM.</p>
<p>Leroy&#8217;s &#8220;assistants&#8221; turned out to be high-end escorts. Some $1000 dollar an hour agency that flies in girls from London, Tokyo and Paris. Apparently, the branch manager wanted to meet the man behind such a large cash infusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our business is very cash-intensive, as you can imagine,&#8221; Leroy told the manager. &#8220;We&#8217;ve blanketed the Northeast with our machines, but see a huge opportunity for us to expand in the South. Please, don&#8217;t mention this to the press, but we are about to acquire one of our major competitors in the Southeast. Hence the infusion of capital in this market.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, Mr. Danforth. And we are glad to have your business. Thank you for meeting me in person. Is there anything else we can help you with today?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mordecai looked to his assistants. &#8220;The withdrawals,&#8221; one said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah yes,&#8221; said Mordecai, &#8220;we will begin making withdrawals next week. Does Tuesday work for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. How much are we talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-five million.&#8221;</p>
<p>The branch manager suddenly found it difficult to swallow. But he did so anyway.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite the sum.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our southern operations are doing quite well of late. An ever-increasing number of small businesses are opting to accept cash only. Our machines go in the corner. Customers get their cash. Everyone is happy, just about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221; It seemed to make sense to the manager. And how could he explain turning down hundreds of millions in business to <em>his</em> boss?</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll need an armored car to transport the funds to our secure holding facility. Will there be a charge for that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Danforth. Let me check with my boss, but I believe we&#8217;d be happy to provide that service to a client such as yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great. I believe that&#8217;s all.&#8221; Leroy turned to his assistants. &#8220;Shall we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pleasure doing business with you,&#8221; said the branch manager.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you, too.&#8221;</p>

<br/><p>While Mordecai was doing business at the bank, I broke into his hotel room. It was simple, really. Using a magnetic card writer and cracked database of common key formats, I cloned Mordecai&#8217;s room key.</p>
<p>The lamp fixture provided some camouflage for a hidden mic. Off in the corner of the room, I installed a spy cam. By the time I ducked out to my rental car, the feed was live.</p>


<br/><p>The next morning, after a night of carnal activities with his &#8220;assistants,&#8221; Mordecai made a call. The mic audio was kind of fuzzy. All I heard was: &#8220;Yeah, this is Kensington &#8230; ATM Distributors &#8230; I&#8217;ll be &#8230; an hour &#8230; 5150 Oa&#8230; I&#8217;ll see you there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmy lost the tale on Mordecai&#8217;s red Corvette convertible. Mordecai had this habit of driving out to the airport and swapping cars, before engaging in illicit activities. Personally, I think he got the idea from that scene in <em>Goodfellas</em>. The one where Ray Liotta&#8217;s character is driving around town everywhere while trying to make meatballs. He thinks he&#8217;s just paranoid, but it turns out he really is being followed by helicopters.</p>
<p>All I had to go on was &#8220;5150 Oa&#8221;&#8211;not much, really. Google Maps to the rescue. The auto-complete feature narrowed down the address to one of two options: Oak Avenue and Oak Dale Drive. Jimmy took the Avenue while I scoped out the Drive.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later I got a text from Jimmy. &#8220;It&#8217;s 5150 Oak Avenue. 100%.&#8221; I made my way over.</p>
<p>Mordecai had really outdone himself this time. It was a large warehouse in an industrial district. &#8220;ATM Distributors Global, Inc.&#8221; read the freshly-painted sign.</p>
<p>I had a sinking feeling in my stomach. Leroy had really stepped up his game. For a moment, I considered turning states evidence and narcing out Mordecai. Or phoning in an anonymous tip to the Feds.</p>
<p>Just then though, three large trucks pulled up to the address. Jimmy and I watched from down the black. Mordecai directed traffic as the construction workers carried large steel sheets into the building.</p>
<p>The fucker. He was construction a vault.</p>

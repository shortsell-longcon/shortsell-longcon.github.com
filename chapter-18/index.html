<div class="entry-content"><br/><p>Armed with Mordecai&#8217;s list of aliases, Jimmy went to work on locating our man. He struck gold at the Hyatt Regency.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said Jimmy, &#8220;can you patch me through to Kensington Danforth? It&#8217;s urgent. He&#8217;s staying in room 742.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, just a second.&#8221; A beat. &#8220;Sir, he&#8217;s staying in room 420. I&#8217;ll patch you through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bingo.</p>
<p>Jimmy setup a surveillance operation at the Hyatt; meanwhile I posted up outside Arkansas National Bank.</p>
<p>After a day of that, I grew restless. A trip to a local spy shop yielded the necessary tools to simply my life. Posing as an electrician, I installed two spy cams across the street from the bank. One above a coffee shop, the other beneath a neon &#8220;Diner&#8221; sign. With a lens the size of a button, the cameras were nearly invisible to the naked eye. They beamed a live feed to a nearby 3G modem. From there the data was sent directly to my server farm in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>I sat back, turned on HBO (quite a perk for the cheap motel), watched, and waited.</p>

<br/><p>That night, Leroy showed up at the hotel, wasted. He was with some chick who was sporting thigh-high, black leather boots.</p>
<p>Jimmy said, &#8220;She&#8217;s quite the looker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s one thing you should know. Leroy&#8217;s quite the fan of the ladies. Paid or not.&#8221;</p>


<br/><p>The next day, I get a text from Jimmy: &#8220;Bishop has left the palace.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few hours later I&#8217;m watching the live feed, when Jimmy pulls up in a Lincoln Town Car. He&#8217;s dressed to the nines in a pinstripe suit. Two women, who <em>appear</em> to be some kind of assistants, step out of the vehicle. &#8220;Bishop is in the pocket,&#8221; I text Jimmy.</p>
<p>He&#8217;d lost the tail at the airport parking lot, so it was a good thing we had the feed.</p>
<p>From what emerged of the case later, we know that Leroy had opened the bank account under the name &#8220;ATM Distributors Global, Inc.&#8221; There was a major ATM distributor by the same name, only, without the Global. These are the people who made a fortune by stocking every mini-part, strip joint and fast-food shop with an ATM.</p>
<p>The women turned out to be high-end escorts, of course. Apparently the branch manager wanted to meet the man behind such a large cash infusion to the bank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our business is very cash-intensive, as you can imagine,&#8221; Leroy told the manager. &#8220;We&#8217;ve blanketed the Northeast with our machines, but see a huge opportunity for us to expand in the south. Please, don&#8217;t mention this to the press, but we are about to acquire one of our major competitors in the Southeast. Hence the infusion of capital in this market.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, Mr. Danforth. And we are glad to have your business. Thank you for meeting me in person. Is there anything else we can help you with today?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mordecai looked to his assistants. &#8220;The withdrawals,&#8221; one said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah yes,&#8221; said Mordecai, &#8220;we will begin making withdrawals next week. Does Tuesday work for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. How much are we talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-five million.&#8221;</p>
<p>The branch manager gulped, hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite the sum.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our southern operations are doing quite well of late. Businesses, wishing to avoid fees from the credit card companies, have been installing our new line of machines in record number.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll need an armored car to transport the funds to our secure holding facility. Will there be a charge for that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Danforth. Let me check with my boss, but I believe we&#8217;d be happy to provide that service to a client such as yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great. I believe that&#8217;s all. Shall we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pleasure doing business with you,&#8221; said the branch manager.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you, too.&#8221;</p>

<br/><p>While Mordecai was doing business at the bank, I broke into his hotel room. It was simple, really. Those new hotel room keys can be reverse-engineered quite easily. Using a magnetic card writer, I made myself a key to Mordecai&#8217;s room.</p>
<p>The lamp fixture provided some camouflage for a hidden mic. Off in the corner of the room, I installed a spy cam. By the time I ducked out to my rental car, the feed was live.</p>


<br/><p>The next morning, after a night of carnal activities with his &#8220;assistants,&#8221; Mordecai made a call. The mic audio was kind of fuzzy. All I heard was: &#8220;Yeah, this is Kensington &#8230; ATM Distributors &#8230; I&#8217;ll be &#8230; an hour &#8230; 5150 Oa&#8230; I&#8217;ll see you there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmy lost the tale on Mordecai&#8217;s red Corvette convertible. Mordecai was savvy enough to drive out to the airport and swap cars before meeting with associates.</p>
<p>Google Maps&#8217; auto-complete feature narrowed down the address to two options: Oak Avenue and Oak Dale Drive. Jimmy took the Avenue while I scoped out the Drive.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s here,&#8221; texted Jimmy. I made my way over.</p>
<p>Mordecai had really outdone himself. It was a large warehouse in an industrial district. &#8220;ATM Distributors Global, Inc.&#8221; read the freshly-painted sign.</p>
<p>I had a sinking feeling in my stomach. Leroy had really stepped up his game. I briefly, briefly considered turning states evidence and narcing out Mordecai. Or phoning in an anonymous tip to the Feds.</p>
<p>Just then three large trucks pulled up to the address. Jimmy and I watched from down the black. Mordecai directed traffic as the construction workers carried large steel sheets into the building.</p>
<p>The fucker. He was construction a vault.</p>

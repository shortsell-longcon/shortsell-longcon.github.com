<div class="entry-content"><br/><p>Cray Wench and his federal boys were cold on the trail of one Mr. Leroy Brown. I was sure they knew about me, as in, someone like me, but they did not yet have my real name. Not yet. I bounced my trading sessions through so many web proxies and SSH tunnels, it would take months to get warrants from all of the providers. Let alone the obstacle of international service providers. Why should a hosting company in Sweden comply with the request of an American court? Or, think of it this way: should Exxon Mobil just hand over its server logs if it were demanded by an Iranian court of law? Of course not.</p>
<p>Three different companies had passed along our keysniffers to the FBI&#8217;s Cybercrimes division. These companies, at the request of the FBI, also forwarded all employee, visitor and contractor logs. But Wench was stuck; none of the names yielded any clues.</p>
<p>He had a hunch, though. After making a few calls, Cray Wench discovered that all three NYC-based companies used the same janitorial services contractor. Wench made some calls and learned that at one point, one Mr. Franz Abignail had been the cleaning crew manager on duty at all three locations. As it turned out, Abignail was one very poorly chosen alias by Mordecai. He happened to work these jobs, as I was busy managing the growth of our technical infrastructure. He must&#8217;ve gotten sloppy, planting the sniffers on low-value, high-risk targets.</p>
<p>The cleaning firm sent over a copy of Abignail&#8217;s fake ID, giving Wench another vital piece of the ever-growing puzzle.</p>


<br/><p>Mordecai&#8217;s headshot made the rounds across every FBI office in the nation. An APB of sorts. At the Boston FBI office, one enterprising young agent thought the elaborate insider trading scam sounded familiar. The work of a real long con. One with brains to boot. Among Boston agents, there was lore of a suspected Harvard infiltrator, but because the University refused to press charges, the Feds never got involved. The enterprising agent took Abignail&#8217;s headshot down to Harvard. The Administration still refused to acknowledge the existence of Mordecai.</p>
<p>After several meetings, the agency came away empty-handed. The next day, however, the young agent received a mysterious, FedEx package. It was the complete Harvard file on Mordecai. His freshman-year photo indicated that Franz Abignail was in fact the same individual who had cheated his way into Harvard. As part of the agreement, Mordecai gave up his real identity to the Harvard administration: Lawrence Brown.</p>
<p>The federalies&#8217; investigation now had legs. Wench went public the next morning; Leroy&#8217;s mug was splashed across every major paper in the nation. Down at my local Starbucks the next morning, I froze in horror as Leroy&#8217;s visage stared back at me. &#8220;Ex-Harvard Con Turned Insider Trading Millionaire&#8221; read the headline. I hustled home to check Google News.</p>
<p>&#8220;Former Harvard Student Caught in Elaborate Con&#8221; read the headline in USA Today. The Wall Street Journal ran with: &#8220;From Harvard to Janitor, to Insider Trading Tycoon.&#8221;</p>

<br/><p>I had to get down to Little Rock. Somehow. In the previous six months, I&#8217;d obtained three valid driver&#8217;s licenses. New York, New Jersey and California. It was me in the picture, but the identities belonged to someone else. A real person who had the same height/build/etc. Also&#8211;one valid US passport, created in similar fashion; another from New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was time to hit the road. I packed my best three laptops, some externals and my surveillance gear. Oh, and $150k in cash that I&#8217;d set aside for this kind of occasion (a rainy day kind of fund).</p>
<p>In an ideal world, I&#8217;d have time to run Boot &amp; Nuke on all of my hard disks before taking off. Most people think you can just reformat a hard drive and the data is gone. But if you&#8217;ve ever seen CSI, you know that the latent data is still there, lurking. Millions of incriminating 1s and 0s.</p>
<p>I ejected all of my drives and collected the remaining USB jump sticks. Wrapped in several garbage bags, duct-taped to a brick, the Wallabout Bay would have to be the final resting place of my beloved terabytes. I made about seventeen turns along the way. I donned a Yankees cap, parked the car and walked out on the bridge. I could barely hear the <em>plop</em> as the bag descended to the bottom of the Bay.</p>


<br/><p>Dark sunglasses and a Yankees cap were the best I could do for a disguise. A quick trip to Avis and I was on the road, headed south in a mid-sized sedan. Traveling by air would be too risky. The drive to Little Rock took a full two days, as speeding was not a luxury I could afford.</p>
<p>In Little Rock, I settled into a cheap motel. Hopped on their shitty Wifi and found a local PI by the name of Jimmy Radcliffe. He was your tried and true dick. Wore a shabby brown sports coat with patches on the elbows. Said he mostly handled divorce cases. Dick and Janes who thought their significant other was porking the office hottie. We chatted for a few, then he said, &#8220;Yeah, most private investigators are ex-law enforcement. Fuckin&#8217; pigs. I come from &#8230; let&#8217;s just say, not that line of work.&#8221; I&#8217;d found my man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmy, I&#8217;m looking for an investigator with a certain &#8230; eye for discretion. In exchange, I&#8217;m willing to pay. And pay well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmy uncrossed his fingers, leaned over and picked up a cigar. The thing was massive (think Bob Marley). He said, &#8220;I &#8230; believe that can be arranged.&#8221;</p>
<p>I took out ten g&#8217;s and laid it on him. He flipped through the bills.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, this&#8217;ll work,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a retainer,&#8221; I said. &#8220;You never told me your rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sixty dollars per hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll triple that. But the remaining two thirds will be held in escrow until six months after our business completes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He mulled over my proposal, bellowing huge rings of smoke into the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cash?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; I said. &#8220;The remaining two thirds will be delivered to you via FedEx, assuming the confidentiality of our arrangement remains intact.&#8221;</p>
<p>A smile crept across his mustached face. &#8220;Deal,&#8221; he said.</p>

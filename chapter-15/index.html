<div class="entry-content"><br/><p>You&#8217;re probably wondering how I got the money back. Well, $250 million of it anyways. I&#8217;ll get to that, but first&#8211;</p>
<p>Frank Hardt and the SEC boys were by now hot on our trail. They were zeroing in on the biggest insider trading empire ever assembled.</p>
<p>They&#8217;d managed to gain access to a few of our accounts from countries that had signed mutual trade/finance agreements with the US. Unlike our secure accounts in the Caymans, Gibraltar, and Vanuatu, some of the foreign banks we used were forced to turn over the family jewels. From there it was pretty easy to monitor our activity and see what we were up to. They didn&#8217;t close any of the accounts or seize any of the money. Not yet. They just sat there, watched, and waited.</p>
<p>The investigation was getting a little above the pay grade for the boys at the SEC. They called in the DoJ, who forwarded the case over to the FBI&#8217;s Fraud and Cybercrimes division. There it came under the jurisdiction of one hard-nosed, seasoned veteran by the name of Cray Wench. His case records, from what I could find online, indicated that he was one mean sonofabitch. Had a reputation for bringing down all of the big names on the Fed&#8217;s Top 10 Most Wanted list. After an injury on the job, Wench took a lateral move and became head investigator for the Cybercrimes division.</p>
<p>This was Cray&#8217;s first big case in that unit, and he smelled blood. His usual docket was filled with your low-level schemers who managed to embezzle a few million here, a few million there. Ukranian hackers caught on ATM surveillance tapes, withdrawing thousands from cloned credit cards. You know, the usual small-time stuff. We were big fish in his little pond, and Wench wanted nothing more than to fry us up for dinner.</p>


<br/><p>On the phone, bank after bank confirmed a wire transfer, timed exactly at 4pm EST. Leroy had guesstimated the expected balance, and cleaned out nearly every account. On some, he even managed to overdraw thousands. Hence the overall net negative balance.</p>
<p>Mordecai had timed it perfectly. Slimy bastard. At precisely the close of NYSE trading, all funds were wired to an unknown offshore account. The bank listed was Abdullah Assets Worldwide Ltd. The trail grew cold from there.</p>
<p>I knew Mordecai had probably bounced the funds halfway around the world, but I wasn&#8217;t about to let him get away&#8211;not without a fight.</p>


<br/><p>To be completely honest, Mordecai&#8217;s double-cross reignited a fire in my belly. The whole operation had taken its toll. The longer it lasted, the more it felt like a day job, and less like a hot startup. Tracking down Mordecai would be my new challenge. Instead of The Hunted, I became The Hunter.</p>
<p>And my prey was no easy target. I knew Leroy Mordecai Brown to be perhaps the world&#8217;s most adept social engineer. Unsophisticated? Yes. Unskilled? No. In another lifetime, perhaps born of a different bloodline, Mordecai would have been Bill Clinton redux. Or perhaps an Andy Kaufman or Sacha Baron Cohen. Who knows? If he had pulled it off at Harvard, Mordecai could be at Oxford right now. Perhaps going on to get his JD before arguing cases before the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>But I knew Mordecai, like any person or system, has flaws. And I would find them, use them, and exploit them.</p>

<br/><p>Googling Abdullah Assets revealed it to be a major player in the Middle East. A global bank, headquartered in Bahrain. Shit.</p>
<p>Bahrain is one of the toughest nuts to crack. Unlike Saudi Arabia, they have international agreement with the US that would compel banks to hand over private banking information.</p>
<p>I gave Charley a call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know anyone who works at Abdullah Assets Worldwide Limited?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uhh&#8230; Let me think.&#8221; He paused for a sec. &#8220;No. But I can make some calls. Is that where the money went?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Appears so. Find me someone, Charley. Stat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charley called me back in fifteen. Turns out a friend of a friend once worked there. Charley put me in touch with an Abdullah account rep. I gave him a call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have much time so I&#8217;m going to be blunt. Someone stole a very large amount of money from me, and they&#8217;re using Abdullah as a conduit. We can wait until I get the Feds involved, and it won&#8217;t be pretty. Or we can do it the easy way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what this is going to sound like. It&#8217;s going to sound like The Spanish Prisoner&#8211;the confidence trick. I&#8217;m some kind of Nigerian prince who has twenty-three million dollars in a bank somewhere, and all I need you to do is to wire me twenty g&#8217;s. But I&#8217;m not going to ask you for twenty grand. I&#8217;m not going to ask you for a dime. All I need is the name of the bank and some routing numbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir, I uh &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just listen. In exchange for this small but vital piece of information, I will give you, and I swear, on the life of my mother, one million dollars. I would say five million, but you wouldn&#8217;t believe me. Let&#8217;s just say, if I am able to retrieve my funds, I wouldn&#8217;t think twice about wiring one-point-five million USD into a bank account of your choosing.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a long pause on the other end of the line.</p>
<p>I continued, &#8220;I will give you five seconds to accept this offer, and then I&#8217;m hanging up the phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>I waited a moment before saying, &#8220;Five &#8230; four &#8230; three &#8230; two &#8230; one&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A cheshire grin crept across my face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know who you are. And frankly, that was one helluva sell job. But really&#8211;I get paid eighty grand a year to shuffle around other people&#8217;s millions. Some seventeen-year-old Shiek&#8217;s son totals his Ferrari in London, and I wire him another three-hundred grand. That&#8217;s my job. So you know what? I&#8217;m going to help you. Even if you&#8217;re full of shit, I&#8217;ll have one helluva story to tell my girl back home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, you got a deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I lookup the account?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would give you a name but I have no clue what alias he&#8217;s using. You&#8217;re going to have to search your records for a new account that had over five-hundred million US dollars deposited into it today.&#8221;</p>
<p>The line went so quiet, it felt like a sealed vacuum tube.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8211;uhh &#8230;&#8221; he stammered. <em>Would he want a bigger cut?</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Five hundred million,&#8221; I said, &#8220;roughly. That&#8217;s all I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8211;Okay. I will see what I can do. Where can I reach you at?&#8221;</p>
<p>I gave him the number to my burner.</p>

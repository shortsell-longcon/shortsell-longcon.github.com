<div class="entry-content"><br/><p>Cray Wench had discovered my identity. I don&#8217;t know how he did it, but the Feds had tracked down the address of my Upper West Side apartment. My landlord confirmed that it was me in the photo. And thus I became the target of a worldwide manhunt. The USA Today headline read: &#8220;Ex-Harvard Hacker Implicated in Insider Trading Scheme.&#8221;</p>
<p>The media called us the &#8220;Harvard Bandits,&#8221; despite the fact that we hadn&#8217;t <em>stolen</em> a dime, technically. Wench had Charley on his list of suspected accomplices, but there wasn&#8217;t enough evidence to bring about a grand jury.</p>
<p>Two days of hiding out in the woods and I was itching to move. I finally hit the freeway; didn&#8217;t stop for a hundred miles.</p>
<p>I scoped out a map and found three national parks in the area. Ones with deep paths that allowed motor vehicle access. After hours, I snuck into the parks and buried the loot. Three parks; three chunks of loot. Even if they get one? Hey, I&#8217;ve still got the other two.</p>
<p>But there was one thing I had to do before disappearing for a while: I had to say goodbye to my mom.</p>


<br/><p>I know, I know. Stupid, idiotic move. But I had to. She <em>is</em> my mom, after all, and I was about to disappear for life. Sure I&#8217;d try to get ahold of her later, but I didn&#8217;t know how long I&#8217;d be on the run.</p>
<p>The feds would be watching her. Had probably even convinced her to wear a wire. But I didn&#8217;t care. I called her from a fresh burner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;[redacted], what have you done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma. Look, ma, I can explain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Explain? How can you explain <em>this</em>? My own son&#8211;a criminal!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, ma, look&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your face splashed across the front page of the Post. How do you think that makes me feel? I was so proud of you, what with you goin tah Harvard and all. And then you had to go and do this. The shame&#8211;<em>the shame!</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well I haven&#8217;t been convicted yet. You know&#8211;innocent until proven guilty? And the real con&#8211;you know who that is, ma.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Lawrence Brown, your friend Mordecai? He seemed like such a nice young man when I met him at Harvard that time. How could you get yourself mixed up in something like this? <em>How?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, ma, I know they&#8217;re listening in on this call. And I know they&#8217;ll try and stop us from meeting, but I just want to see you one last time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re my son&#8211;my only son. Of course I&#8217;ll meet you, but&#8211;and they probably don&#8217;t want me saying this&#8211;you be careful, you hear me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear you, ma. Look &#8230; I need you to meet me tomorrow at five p.m., Grand Central Station. Beneath the big American flag.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8211;Okay. I&#8217;ll be there.&#8221; She coughed a few times while saying, &#8220;and so will the Eff-Bee-Eye &#8230; the Eff-Bee-Eye &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, ma. I can look out for myself. I&#8217;ll see you there. I love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you, too. You know I always will &#8230; even <em>if</em> you&#8217;re some kind of finance criminal &#8230;&#8221; she said, trailing off.</p>


<br/><p>For my final public appearance, it was time to get creative. I made a call to an old Harvard buddy who had a connection with Improv Everywhere. They&#8217;re a comedy troupe in NYC; famously known for their flash mob hijinks. You may have seen their <em>No Pants Subway Ride</em> or <em>Grocery Store Musical</em> videos on YouTube. They normally don&#8217;t take requests, but the founder liked my idea.</p>
<p>For my disguise, I wore a suit, a trench coat, a top hat and sunglasses. Clutching a briefcase, I made my way across Grand Central, hugging the crowds. At five &#8216;til, I spotted my mother beneath the giant American flag.</p>
<p>I texted her: &#8220;walk thirty feet toward the throng of people.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she disappeared into the crowd, I followed from afar. Deep in the crowd, I spotted her from behind. &#8220;Mom,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>She turned. &#8220;What have you <em>done</em>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know &#8230; I know. Look, ma, I really screwed up &#8230; I know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have much time. I could feel the Federal agents, swarming like invisible hornets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma, I just want to say. I love you. And that I&#8217;m sorry. I never should&#8217;ve got myself mixed up in all this &#8230; but, it&#8217;s too late now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, sonny. You know I&#8217;m disappointed in you. But&#8211;I&#8217;ll always love you, no matter what.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was my last chance, so I gave her a big bear hug. I hit &#8220;Send&#8221; on my phone and let it ring. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a man with a white earpiece, whispering something into his shirt sleeve.</p>
<p>He lunged at me!</p>
<p>I ducked out of the way and yelled into my cell phone&#8217;s mouthpiece, &#8220;Now!&#8221;</p>
<p>The sound of the Village People&#8217;s <em>YMCA</em> boomed to life. An iPod playing the Village People hit was being piped into an FM transmitter. A dozen boomboxes were then tuned to the custom FM channel. They blasted to life as soon as my accomplice flipped the switch on his iPod.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the throng of people around us threw off their overcoats to reveal Village People outfits. There were about thirty dancers in all&#8211;the Improv Everywhere ensemble. Each character was well-represented&#8211;The Cowboy, The Cop, The Construction Worker, The Indian, The Bear (for lack of a better word) and The Sailor. The mob spread out, dancing in formation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another group of people&#8211;about fifteen in all&#8211;donned large brown afro wigs and stunner shades. They circled the dancers and worked the crowd like so many hype men.</p>
<p>I ducked down, stripped off my trench coat and donned a large afro wig and shades.</p>
<p>Pandemonium unfurled, as you can imagine. Five agents rushed into the crowd of dancers. Traffic ground to a halt as hundreds of onlookers gathered around.</p>
<p>I made my way into the crowd, dancing and clapping like the other hype men.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><br/><p>Cray Wench had discovered my identity. I don&#8217;t know how he did it, but the feds had tracked down the address of my Upper West Side apartment. My landlord gave positive ID; that was that.</p>
<p>And thus I became the target of a worldwide manhunt. The USA Today headline read: &#8220;Ex-Harvard Hacker Implicated in Insider Trading Scheme.&#8221;</p>
<p>The media called us the &#8220;Harvard Bandits,&#8221; despite the fact that we hadn&#8217;t <em>stolen</em> a dime, technically. Wench had Charley on his list of suspected accomplices, but there wasn&#8217;t enough evidence to bring a grand jury.</p>
<p>Two days of hiding out in the woods and I was ready to make my escape. I won&#8217;t go into all the details, but I managed to secure the funds at a variety of locations. Public Storage units, mostly. I had to get out of the States, and fast.</p>
<p>But there was one thing I had to do before disappearing for a while: I had to say goodbye to my mom.</p>


<br/><p>I know, I know. Dumb move. But I had to. She was my mom, and I was about to disappear for life. Sure I&#8217;d try to get ahold of her later, but I didn&#8217;t know how long I&#8217;d be on the run.</p>
<p>The feds would be watching her. Had probably even convinced her to wear a wire. But I didn&#8217;t care. I called her from a fresh burner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;[redacted], what have you done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma. Look, ma, I can explain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Explain? You can explain <em>this</em>? I don&#8217;t think so. My friends at the spa won&#8217;t let me hear the end of it, [redacted]!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, ma, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your face on every paper. How do you think that makes me feel? That I raised a con.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well I haven&#8217;t been convicted, yet. You know&#8211;innocent until proven guilty? And the real con&#8211;you know who that is, ma.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Lawrence? He seemed like such a nice young man when I met him at Harvard that time. How could you get yourself mixed up in something like this? How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, ma, I know they&#8217;re listening in on this call. And I know they&#8217;ll try and stop us from meeting, but I just want to see you one last time. I have to take a little trip &#8230; after we meet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine. My son. My only son. Of course I&#8217;ll meet with you, but&#8211;and they probably don&#8217;t want me saying this&#8211;you be careful, you hear me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear you, ma. Look&#8211;I need you to meet me tomorrow at five p.m., Grand Central Station. Beneath the big American flag.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8211;Okay. I&#8217;ll be there.&#8221; She coughed a few times while saying, &#8220;F-B-I will too, F-B-I will too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, ma. I can look out for myself. I&#8217;ll see you there. I love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you too.&#8221;</p>


<br/><p>For my final public appearance, it was time to get creative. I made a call to an old Harvard buddy who had a connection with Improv Everywhere. They&#8217;re a comedy troupe in NYC; famously known for their flash mob hijinks. You may have seen their <em>No Pants Subway Ride</em> or <em>Grocery Store Musical</em> videos on YouTube. They normally don&#8217;t take requests, but the founder liked my idea.</p>
<p>For my disguise, I wore a 1970&#8217;s-era suit, a trench coat, a top hat and sunglasses. Clutching a briefcase, I made my way across Grand Central, hugging the crowds. At five &#8216;til, I spotted my mom beneath the giant American flag.</p>
<p>I texted her: &#8220;walk thirty feet toward the throng of people.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she disappeared into the crowd, I followed from afar.</p>
<p>Deep in the throng of people, I saw her from behind. &#8220;Mom,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>She turned. &#8220;What have you done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, I know. I really screwed up this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have much time. Federal agents were swarming as we spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma, I just want to say. I love you. And that I&#8217;m sorry. I never should&#8217;ve got mixed up in all this &#8230; but, it&#8217;s too late now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know&#8211;son. I&#8217;m disappointed in you. But I&#8217;ll always love you, no matter what.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was my last chance, so I gave her a big hug. I dialed a number on my phone, but didn&#8217;t yet speak. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a man with a white earpiece, whispering something into his shirt sleeve. He lunged for me, but I ducked out of the way, yelling &#8220;Now!&#8221; into my cell.</p>
<p>The sound of the Village People&#8217;s <em>YMCA</em> boomed to life. A dozen boomboxes were tuned to a custom FM channel. An iPod playing the Village People was piped into an FM transmitter. The range was about fifty feet.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the throng of people around us threw off their overcoats to reveal Village People outfits. There were about thirty dancers in all&#8211;the Improv Everywhere ensemble. Each character was well-represented&#8211;The Cowboy, The Cop, The Construction Worker, The Indian, The Bear (for lack of a better word) and The Sailor. The mob spread out, dancing in formation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another group of people&#8211;about fifteen in all&#8211;donned large brown afro wigs and stunner shades. They circled the dancers and worked the crowd like so many hype men.</p>
<p>I ducked down, stripped off my trench coat and donned a large afro wig and shades.</p>
<p>Pandemonium unfurled, as you can imagine. Five agents rushed into the crowd of dancers. Traffic ground to a halt as hundreds of onlookers gathered around.</p>
<p>I made my way into the crowd, dancing and clapping like the other hype men.</p>

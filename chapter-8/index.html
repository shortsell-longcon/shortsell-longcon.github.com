<div class="entry-content"><br/><p>You might be wondering: when the stock price would inevitably fall from the layoff announcement, how were we going to make money? Can&#8217;t you only make money when a stock goes <em>up</em>?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where short-selling comes in.</p>
<p>There are two primary ways to make money when a stock price falls. One is called <em>selling short</em>&#8211;it&#8217;s when you make a promise to sell a stock at its current trading price, at some future date. An example. Let&#8217;s say I short 100 shares of IBM at $100. The price shoots up to $120. I&#8217;m fucked. Sooner or later, I&#8217;m going to run out of margin and be forced to sell IBM, at $100 a share. That means I just lost 100 x $20 (the difference in stock price).</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s say the price of IBM instead drops to $70. The party on the other end of the short sale has made a promise to buy it back at $100 a share. That&#8217;s how short-selling works. In this example, I made 100 x $30. Just think of it as the exact opposite of buying a stock and hoping it goes up. You are &#8220;selling&#8221; a stock and hoping it goes down. Some investors think that selling short is, somehow, unethical. These people tend to believe that the Dow Jones should be at 30,000 and that every stock they invest in should just magically rise exponentially, without regard to underlying financials. Think of selling short like like playing Blackjack at the casino. Most people are simply going to be throwing away money, because stocks tend to rise over the longterm. But every once in a while, if you really know what you&#8217;re doing (e.g. betting against banks during a housing bubble), you&#8217;re going to make a killing.</p>


<br/><p>The other way to profit from a stock price declining is through PUT options. Remember the CALL option discussion from before, about the orange juice futures? PUT options work the same way, in reverse.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave it at that. Suffice it to say, options give you a ton of leverage. But they&#8217;re usually only effective when a stock price swings wildly. If a stock only swings 1-3% in either direction, you&#8217;re probably not going to make much dough using options.</p>
<p>Perhaps another illustration is in order. Buy $3,000 worth of stock trading at $100. It goes up to $110. You sell, netting you 30 x $10 or just $30.</p>
<p>Buy $3,000 worth of options, allowing you to buy 200 shares at $102. Again, the price shoots to $110. You can buy the shares at $102, then sell them on the open market for $110, netting you an instant profit of $8 per share. 200 shares time $8 is $1,600.</p>
<p>So, using the exact same $3k nut, you could potentially make $1,600 with options, compared to $30 from trading alone. It&#8217;s a contrived example, but you get the idea.</p>


<br/><p>We shorted the stock on Thursday. By Monday afternoon, the CEO had issued a press release stating that the company would be laying off 5,500 workers to, quote, &#8220;remain competitive.&#8221; The stock fell 12% in after-hours trading. The next day, we cashed in, netting over $43,000 in our first big trade.</p>
<p>I felt like that monkey in the experiment when he finally learns how to pull the lever, delivering a dose of pure ecstasy and adrenaline to his brain. Yeah, I was hooked.</p>
<p>Mordecai was now going by a bevy of assumed identities. I could never keep them straight. He loved the goofy names. I thought they sounded suspicious, but he had his characters down so pat, no one suspected a thing. Tommmy Andreeson. Anthony Montagna. George Lebanski.</p>
<p>Leroy had balls&#8211;that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p>He wasn&#8217;t content with our little operation in NYC, so he fanned out all across the eastern seabord. Boston, D.C., Delaware, Virginia, Miami.</p>
<p>I trained Leroy on how to deploy the sniffers. It was pretty basic. If a major new target was in play, I&#8217;d fly out to assess the company&#8217;s IT security. We were after high-value, low-risk targets.</p>


<br/><p>Our next juicy piece of inside corporate gossip came from a major player in Big Oil. We got wind of a new pipeline contract in the Caucasus, between the black and caspian seas. It was kind of a big deal. All the major players were bidding on the pipeline. New revenues for the winning bidder were projected at $250 billion over ten years.</p>
<p>We were still working our way up the food chain at the company, but word leaked down as associates spread the gossip around the virtual water-cooler. The company was getting the pipeline contract through the usual backroom dealings.</p>
<p>Up until this point, we&#8217;d grown our nut through base hits. Small bets, here and there. Our funds had blossomed to $317k. By now, Charley had setup over thirty different offshore corporations. These shell companies, in turn, opened over one hundred brokerage trading accounts.</p>
<p>Mordecai and I were at a bar on the Upper West Side. We tipped a cute bartender $100 to change the channel to BBC Financial.</p>
<p>I nearly shit myself.</p>
<p>The pipeline contract had just been announced; our Big Oil play had moved $27 on the news. I scribbled down a few calculations on the back of a napkin. We had just made, approximately &#8230;</p>

<br/><p>$27.</p>

<br/><p>Million.</p>

<br/><p>Fucking.</p>

<br/><p>Dollars.</p>

<br/><p>I knew it was time for a Dead Man&#8217;s Switch.</p>

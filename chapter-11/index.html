<div class="entry-content"><br/><p>I only learned of this later, but it turns out our little operation had begun to raise a few eyebrows.</p>
<p>Trading options&#8211;that is, PUTs and CALLS&#8211;was critical to our success. We couldn&#8217;t have made the kind of dough we made without them. And yet trading options isn&#8217;t nearly as popular as trading regular stocks. So when the bean counters over at the SEC pour over reams and reams of financial data, looking for anomalous trades &#8230; it&#8217;s a lot easier to spot the fishy-looking PUTs and CALLs.</p>
<p>A low-level SEC agent by the name of Frank Hardt had uncovered what appeared to be an anomaly in the data. One of the things the SEC looks for is a high percentage of winning trades. And, let me tell you&#8211;we were fucking killing it. Our win ratio was through the roof. Keep in mind, most money managers actually fail to beat the market. Everyone tries to beat the S&amp;P 500, but few money managers come close. Even the very best investors&#8211;guys like Warren Buffet&#8211;make winning trades about 55-65% of the time. The rest of the trades are inevitable losers. Of course, our accounts showed almost zero indication of losing trades</p>
<p>When we bet&#8211;we bet small, but we nearly always won.</p>


<br/><p>To switch things up, we targeted a Silicon Alley, Web 2.0 company here in NYC. They made apps and games for the iPhone, Facebook, etc.</p>
<p>Mordecai went undercover as a consultant from McKinley. Our keystroke logging devices had paid out in spades, but the data retrieval was cumbersome at best. We began experimenting with custom rootkits. That is, programs that embed themselves into the OS and masquerade as just another part of the system. The only trick is&#8211;you need access to a machine in order to run the software in the first place. While a PM was out for lunch, Mordecai hopped on his OS X machine and ran our little rootkit.</p>
<p>About a week later, our steady communications from the machine came to a halt. Someone in their IT department had stumbled upon our little malware.</p>
<p>All of this came to light at a security conference in the following months. Apparently we picked the wrong target to mess with. These were no slouchy middle-managers who installed Windows NT and called it a night. The head of security got involved and disassembled our rootkit. Before disabling it, he traced our IP to the server in Amsterdam. Fuck.</p>


<br/><p>The third, independent investigation into our affairs happened on a web forum. We got a little too greedy on an op and found ourselves mixed up in the OTC markets. These are tiny, usually shady, companies that are traded by the penny. Literally, a stock might have a market cap of three million dollars, trading at five cents a share.</p>
<p>The company we targeted was bleeding red. We knew from their books, though, that if they could get a major cash infusion, that they just might be able to ride out the storm and post a profit within six months.</p>
<p>A week later, we learned that they were closing a new round of funding in a cash-equity swap. We put in our CALL options and waited.</p>
<p>When the round closed, the company&#8217;s price jumped three cents a share. We cashed out of our position and moved on. But someone, we think close to the company, noticed the trades. They began asking questions on the forum, and somehow tracked down a few of our offshore holding companies.</p>
<p>We had to close down a few trading accounts. And of course&#8211;avoid any future dealings on the OTC. The profits came quick and easy, but it wasn&#8217;t worth the risk.</p>


<br/><p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking. Why didn&#8217;t I just take the money and run? Cut my losses before it was too late.</p>
<p>Well &#8230; I was going to, but I had a number. $250 million. And that&#8217;s what I walked away with.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what Mordecai&#8217;s number is, or was, because I never asked. But I knew if he kept living the kind of lifestyle I saw in Miami&#8211;I knew the authorities would eventually catch up with him. And I didn&#8217;t want to be there for the perp walk.</p>
<p>As we neared $400 million in assets under management, my escape plans intensified. <em>Just another hundred mil, and I&#8217;m out</em>. Sure I wondered if there&#8217;d be a knock on the door each night. I could barely sleep; chasing Nyquil with Ambien. Every morning I&#8217;d awake in a cold sweat. Men in dark blue jackets, emblazoned with yellow lettering, had kicked in my door and threw a flash bang into my bedroom. I was being led out in handcuffs, the cold steal cutting grooves into my wrists. Just as I&#8217;d reach the back of the party van&#8211;sweet relief&#8211;when I&#8217;d awake, bolting upright in bed as the adrenaline cursed through my veins. <em>Just another hundred million, and I&#8217;m out</em>.</p>


<br/><p>By then Charley had setup in excess of thirty-seven offshore shell compnaies, which in turn controlled some three hundred fifty merchant brokerage accounts. Shit was unreal. I had to build a custom trading engine that could make trades across all the various trading platforms. I pictured our little crew like Voltron. Alone, we were small, feeble individuals. Capable of little.  Together our unique set of skills combined to form a power to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>I was still living in the same shitty studio apartment in Manhatten. Luckily my ceilings were high. So I scaled vertically. Twenty-four inch LCD monitors. Six rows by six columns. Thirty-six monitors in all. It was the most epic battle station to end all battle stations. I called my little trading platform The Milkmaid, because it brought us the cream.
